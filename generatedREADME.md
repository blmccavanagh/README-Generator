## Motivation & Research

The motivation behind this project came from the experience of spending a lot of time creating markdown files for my projects.
This project was built as a tool to save time when writing markdown files.
This project provides the user a template for a README file so that one can be generated in a timely fashion.
In creating this project I learned the use of node and npm.

## Installation

To install my project, simply clone it to your local machine via the link in my GitHub repository. Node must be installed. Once this is installed use ```npm install inquirer``` to install the inquirer. Once these steps have been followed you will be able to run the README generator.

## Usage

To use this application, open the folder in VSCode. Then open a terminal, aking sure it is running from the correct directory. Then, simply run ```node index.js``` and answer the questions provided.
