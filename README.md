## Motivation and Research

The motivation behind this project came from the experience of spending a lot of time creating markdown files for my projects. This project provides the user a template for a README file so that one can be generated in a timely fashion while following established README conventions and standards.

## Development

### Web development technologies

Development of the project was centered around Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser and npm, a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
 
Links to the languges and tools used to build this project are included below:

* Markdown
* Javascript ES6
* Node.js
    * https://nodejs.org/
* npm
    * https://www.npmjs.com/
* npm Inquirer
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer

### Graphic design and branding

Working from a template for a best practice README.md file, using Node.js I developed the needed JavaScript to prompt the user for information to populate the file with the required text. Following established conventions and layout, I ensured the resulting README.md has the ability to display all the relevant information, images and links as well as contact details.

As this project provides a template for other users to create their own README file, the addition of personal branding is unnecessary.

### Challenges

The development of this application required the use of Node.js and npm, including the installation of the Inquirer.js package. These were new technologies for me as a web developer and required testing and research to understand these tools in order to implement them to create a working project for other users.
